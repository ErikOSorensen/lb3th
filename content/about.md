This is the (experimental) electronics and radio lab notebook of Erik Ø. Sørensen (lb3th). 

I'll try to keep this to document my own experimentation and to provide a bit of
accountability - successes and failures should be documented and I should 
take enough measurements to characterize my work. R markdown (blogdown) should help 
me integrate calculations and graphs with text and pictures. 

I've been an on-off electronics tinkerer since high school (when I worked both as
a research assistant and in production at Cargoscan, now part of Mettler Toledo). I know
that understanding something in theory and discovering what works or not in practice
are two different things. The plan is to spend quite a bit of this notebook building
and measuring circuits that are in some ways "trivial" and not directly useful, but I think
this is necessary to gradually build up skills in building and characterizing more
complicated (and useful) things as well.
