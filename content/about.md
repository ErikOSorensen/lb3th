This is the (experimental) electronics and radio lab notebook of Erik Ø. Sørensen (lb3th). 
You can reach me at: sameos@gmail.com

I'll try to keep this to document my own experimentation and to provide a bit of
accountability - successes and failures should be documented, and I should 
take enough measurements to characterize my work. R markdown (blogdown) should help 
me integrate calculations and graphs with text and pictures. 
I think of this as an online analog
to the notebook I kept for physics experiments back in secondary school. 

I've been an on-off electronics tinkerer since high school. I know
that understanding something in theory while reading a text is different from
the understanding that comes from building something and discovering what 
works or doesn't work in practice. 
The plan is to build and measure circuits that are in some ways "trivial" 
and not directly useful, and that I sometimes *know* how should work.
But I think this is necessary to gradually get used to building and characterizing more
complicated (and useful) things as well.
