<div id="current-drawn" class="section level1">
<h1>Current drawn</h1>
<p>From an ambient temperature, I measured how much current the oscillator
drew from the power supply in the first minutes (at 5V). I measured
the current draw every 10th second.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>Very slowly, the current draw continued to drop, at 22:20 the current drawn was 236 mA.</p>
</div>
<div id="frequency-vs-control-voltage" class="section level1">
<h1>Frequency vs control voltage</h1>
<p>If the frequency generated cannot be controlled in a proper window around 10MHz,
the oscillator might be too old and for use. I measured the frequency
generated for some control voltages, and this doesnâ€™t seem like a problem.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>The frequency was measured by my Agilent 53131A with a GPSDO reference
(with a 1s gate time). This seems fairly linear, with about
3.8
Hz/V. The potentiometer on the board has 4.096V from the voltage reference
over 23 turns, so this will give about 0.68
Hz/turn which should make it possible to calibrate it fairly precisely.</p>
</div>
<div id="amplitude" class="section level1">
<h1>Amplitude</h1>
<p>Running freely, without a load, I measured 2.3V peak-to-peak. With the filtration
and the 50 Ohm on-board load resistor that I have adopted from previous designs I measure
around 1V peak-to-peak, which is more or less in line with a 50 Ohm internal
impedance of the oscillator, and a small insertion loss of the low pass filter
I added.</p>
