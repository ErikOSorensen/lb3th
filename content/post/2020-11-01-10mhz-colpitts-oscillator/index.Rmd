I've been thinking about 10MHz to sync the time in the instruments, and also as a
reference for on-air radio. A place to start is with a simple crystal oscillator, and
I build the buffered version of a Colpitts oscillator, in the circuit 
known as the G3UUR oscillator (taken from page 7.38 of "Experimental Methods in RF Design"):

I used a 10MHz crystal that came in a cheap ebay assortment kit. 
The circuit oscillates at what appears, according to my HP53131a counter, at 9,998,127 Hz.
So slightly low - or perhaps my counter is off? Difficult to know without a reference 
(which will come later). For know, I just note that it oscillates at around 10MHz.

Instead of trying to calculate what the output impedance of the circuit is, I use my
Rigol DS2072a oscilloscope to measure the peak-to-peak voltage at the output with
different loads. I press the load resistor directly down on the board. Without any load
except the high-impedance of the oscilloscope, I measure 1.950 Vpp. With the load resistors,
as in the figure below. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- tribble(~load,~vpp,
              49.9, 712,
              1000,1640,
              10, 200,
              100, 1000,
              24, 424,
              150,1150,
              75, 920,
              499,1560)
df %>% ggplot(aes(x=load, y=vpp/1000)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Load resistor (in ohms)", y="Peak-to-peak voltage out (Volts)")
```

Note that for low resistor loads, the amplifier also didn't have enough drive to
preserve the symmetric shape of the signal, which makes me think that we should 
focus on the higher loads for calculating the output impedance. 

The voltage out can be represented as a pure voltage source plus the internal
resistance $R_O$ (output impedance) in series with the resistive load to ground. Then
I am measuring the output at a stage in a voltage divider formed by $R_o$ and my
load resistor $R_L$, 
$$ V_L = \frac{R_L}{R_L+R_O} V_O.$$ So for two different loads $(R_L,R_L')$ 
and measured voltages $(V_L, V_L')$, we get the ration
$$ \frac{V_L'}{V_L} = \frac{R_L'}{R_L+R_L'} \frac{R_O + R_L}{R_L},$$
solving this and putting into a function, we have
```{r}
output_impedance <- function(v1,v2,r1,r2) {
  vratio <- v2/v1
  rratio <- r2/r1
  (r2 - vratio * r2) /(vratio - rratio)
}
```

Using the 100R and 500R measurements, I calculate an output impedance of `r format(output_impedance(1000, 1560, 100, 500), digits=2)`, with
the 50R, 150R I get `r format(output_impedance(712,1150,50,150), digits=2)`. With the lower resistor of 50Ohm, the curve shape was distorted most, 
so I go with the interpretation of about 80 ohm output impedance. Matching to 50Ohm would require a transformer with a turns-ratio
of `r format(sqrt(80/50), digits=2)`, I'm not sure that would be worth it for now.
