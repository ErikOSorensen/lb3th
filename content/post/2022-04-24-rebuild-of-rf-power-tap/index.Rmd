Last week I built a 40 dB tap as a proof of concept, but
two things held me back from declaring a full success:

1. I didn't have metal film resistors that could take the full power of a
100W transmitter.
2. The plate-capacitor through coupling didn't seem very sturdy, and I made
a through connection with a straight wire that was a tad bit on the inductive 
side.

# Build

Now I have received 2W metal film resistors from Mouser, and I have built the
plate capacitor solution with a piece of circuit board material that is held
in place with nylon bolts. This is mechanically quite secure:

# Measuring with NanoVNA Saver
I figured out how to connect the nanoVNA to the computer with [NanoVNA Saver](https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver). This allows me to
either save a screenshot of what I saw while watchin the tiny screen when
I adjusted the length of the small wire capacitor that is parallel to the
power resistors:

This shows that the power tap works quite well from 1 to 500 MHz, minimum
return loss is almost 21 dB, at 440 MHz. The through insertion loss is very small.

# Attempts to load NanoVNA touchstone files into R

There is a package by Aaron Anderson, [rftk: RF Toolkit](https://github.com/aaronmanderson3/rftk) that supposedly can read
touchstone files, do RF calculations and display data using ggplot. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rftk)
```

Now, it should be possible to read the touchstone files saved by NanoVNA saver:
```{r}
df_thru <- read_snp("40dB_pad.s2p")
df_pad <- read_snp("40dB_pad_attenuation.s2p")
```

We can take a look at the content of one of these files:
```{r}
head(df_thru)
```
The S12 and S22 parameters are not available in from the Nano VNA.

So we can now plot the return loss and insertion loss of a through 
connection:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_thru %>% filter(parameter %in% c("S11","S21")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=db, x = frequency, color = parameter)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( x = "Frequency [MHz]",
        y = "S-parameter [dB]",
        title = "VNA across input and output") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

Similarly, I have another set of measurement, with the VNA from
input to the attenuated tap (and 50 ohm termination of output).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_pad %>% filter(parameter %in% c("S11","S21")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=db, x = frequency, color = parameter)) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( x = "Frequency [MHz]",
        y = "S-parameter [dB]",
        title = "VNA across input and attenuator output") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```


In theory, it should also be possible to plot these data on a Smith chart,
there is a `geom_smith` extension to ggplot.
The required aesthetics to the `geom_smith` are `freq`, `smag`, and `sang`.
Frequency must be in Hz. From the example in the help, it is clear that `sang`
is angle in radians (whereas the file was read with angles in degrees). 
I suspect that the `smag` might be the magnitude of the 
reflection coefficient, in which case $$|\Gamma| = 10^{S_{11}/20},$$
with $|\Gamma|$ being the magnitude of the reflection coefficient.
Let's try to put that into the Smith chart command.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmp <- df_thru %>% filter(parameter == "S11") %>%
  mutate(smag = 10^(db/20),
         sang = ang*pi/180)
tmp %>%  ggplot(aes(freq = frequency,
                     smag = smag,
                     sang = sang, 
                    color = frequency)) +
  geom_smith() + 
  labs(title = "VNA across input and output, attenuator terminated") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

And for the attenuation output:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_pad %>% filter(parameter == "S11") %>%
  mutate(smag = 10^(db/20),
         sang = ang*pi/180) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(freq = frequency,
                     smag = smag,
                     sang = sang, 
                    color = frequency)) +
  geom_smith() + 
  labs(title = "VNA across input and attenuator output") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

I suspect that there are commands in `rftk` to do the conversion between
S-parameters and reflection coefficient, but it seems as if the documentation
is still not finished.
