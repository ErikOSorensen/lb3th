<p>Last week I built a 40 dB tap as a proof of concept, but
two things held me back from declaring a full success:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I didn’t have metal film resistors that could take the full power of a
100W transmitter.</li>
<li>The plate-capacitor through coupling didn’t seem very sturdy, and I made
a through connection with a straight wire that was a tad bit on the inductive
side.</li>
</ol>
<div id="build" class="section level1">
<h1>Build</h1>
<p>Now I have received 2W metal film resistors from Mouser, and I have built the
plate capacitor solution with a piece of circuit board material that is held
in place with nylon bolts. This is mechanically quite secure:</p>

<h1>Measuring with NanoVNA Saver</h1>
<p>I figured out how to connect the nanoVNA to the computer with <a href="https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver">NanoVNA Saver</a>. This allows me to
either save a screenshot of what I saw while watchin the tiny screen when
I adjusted the length of the small wire capacitor that is parallel to the
power resistors:</p>

<p>This shows that the power tap works quite well from 1 to 500 MHz, minimum
return loss is almost 21 dB, at 440 MHz. The through insertion loss is very small.</p>

<h1>Attempts to load NanoVNA touchstone files into R</h1>
<p>There is a package by Aaron Anderson, <a href="https://github.com/aaronmanderson3/rftk">rftk: RF Toolkit</a> that supposedly can read
touchstone files, do RF calculations and display data using ggplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(rftk)</code></pre>
<p>Now, it should be possible to read the touchstone files saved by NanoVNA saver:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_thru &lt;- read_snp(&quot;40dB_pad.s2p&quot;)
df_pad &lt;- read_snp(&quot;40dB_pad_attenuation.s2p&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can take a look at the content of one of these files:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(df_thru)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   parameter frequency        db     ang
##   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 S11         1000000  -35.5    177.   
## 2 S21         1000000   -0.0802  -0.204
## 3 S12         1000000 -Inf        0    
## 4 S22         1000000 -Inf        0    
## 5 S11         5990000  -36.1    171.   
## 6 S21         5990000   -0.0834  -1.15</code></pre>
<p>The S12 and S22 parameters are not available in from the Nano VNA.</p>
<p>So we can now plot the return loss and insertion loss of a through
connection:</p>

<p>Similarly, I have another set of measurement, with the VNA from
input to the attenuated tap (and 50 ohm termination of output).</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>In theory, it should also be possible to plot these data on a Smith chart,
there is a <code>geom_smith</code> extension to ggplot.
The required aesthetics to the <code>geom_smith</code> are <code>freq</code>, <code>smag</code>, and <code>sang</code>.
Frequency must be in Hz. From the example in the help, it is clear that <code>sang</code>
is angle in radians (whereas the file was read with angles in degrees).
I suspect that the <code>smag</code> might be the magnitude of the
reflection coefficient, in which case <span class="math display">\[|\Gamma| = 10^{S_{11}/20},\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(|\Gamma|\)</span> being the magnitude of the reflection coefficient.
Let’s try to put that into the Smith chart command.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>And for the attenuation output:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>I suspect that there are commands in <code>rftk</code> to do the conversion between
S-parameters and reflection coefficient, but it seems as if the documentation
is still not finished.</p>
