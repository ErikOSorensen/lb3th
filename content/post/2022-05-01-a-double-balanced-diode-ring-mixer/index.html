<p>I decided to build a diode ring (double) balanced mixer. The
design of these is fairly straight forward:</p>
<p><img src="images/mixer.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>I built it twice. The first time I wound the transformers on T50-6 cores and
used 1n4148 diodes. This didnâ€™t work very well. I concluded after
a while that there were two issues working against it: First, the inductive
reactance in parallel with the load would be low, loading down the generators.
Second, a large drive level would be necessary to turn two 1n4148 diodes on
at the same time.</p>
<p>The second time I wound the two transformers with 8 turns of trifilar wire
on FT50-43 cores (I aimed for 10, but could only fit 8 turns of the insulated
wire I used). I used 1n5711 Schottky diodes. These were my last 1n5711s, I need
to order more, so matching these was not a possibility.
The build is not beautiful, but it seemed to work:</p>
