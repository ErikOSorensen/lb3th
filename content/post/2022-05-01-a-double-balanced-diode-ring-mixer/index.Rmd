I decided to build a diode ring (double) balanced mixer. The 
design of these is fairly straight forward:

I built it twice. The first time I wound the transformers on T50-6 cores and
used 1n4148 diodes. This didn't work very well. I concluded after
a while that there were two issues working against it: First, the inductive
reactance in parallel with the load would be low, loading down the generators.
Second, a large drive level would be necessary to turn two 1n4148 diodes on
at the same time. 

The second time I wound the two transformers with 8 turns of trifilar wire
on FT50-43 cores (I aimed for 10, but could only fit 8 turns of the insulated
wire I used). I used 1n5711 Schottky diodes. These were my last 1n5711s 
so matching these was not a possibility (I need to order more).
The build is not beautiful:

I decided to make some measurement mixing 5 MHz to 9 MHz with a 14 MHz
local oscillator. This would give 5 and 14 should give mixing products
at 9 and 19 MHz. I used my HP signal generator to provide the 5 MHz
RF and my Rigol function generator to provide the (sine) local oscillator. 
I tried a couple of different levels of RF and LO drive, and recorded the 
magnitudes of the two mixing products (and the RF and LO) on the IF port. 
All measurements were made with the Tiny SA at the IF port.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mdf <- tribble(~LO_driveVpp, ~RF_level, ~IF_5, ~IF_9, ~IF_14, ~IF_19,
               2, -20, -59.7, -23.7, -43.6, -24.1,
               2, -30, -69.2, -33.2, -43.6, -34.6,
               2, -40, -79.2, -43.7, -43.6, -45.1,
               2, -50, -88.7, -53.7, -43.6, -54.6,
               3, -20, -60.7, -23.2, -39.6, -24.1,
               3, -30, -70.0, -33.2, -39.6, -34.1,
               3, -40, -79.6, -43.7, -39.6, -45.1,
               3, -50, -90.2, -53.7, -39.6, -54.6,
               1, -20, -59.2, -23.7, -51.1, -24.6,
               1, -30, -68.7, -33.7, -51.1, -34.6,
               1, -40, -78.7, -44.2, -51.1, -45.1,
               1, -50, -88.2, -54.2, -51.1, -55.1) %>%
  mutate(LO_drive = 20*log10(LO_driveVpp) +3.98) %>%
  select(-LO_driveVpp) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("IF_"),
               names_prefix = "IF_",
               values_to = "IF_level",
               names_to = "IF_freq") %>%
  mutate( frequency_f = factor(IF_freq, 
                               levels = c("5","9","14","19"), 
                               ordered=TRUE))
```

The main mixing products depend on the RF level, but not so much on the
drive levels that I've been looking at:

 ```{r echo=FALSE}
mdf %>% filter(IF_freq %in% c(9,19)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=RF_level, y =  IF_level, color = factor(LO_drive))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "RF level [dBm]",
       y = "IF level [dBm]") +
  facet_wrap( ~frequency_f)
```

For both of these mixing products there is an conversion loss of between
4 and 5 dB. I don't know how good or bad that is, but I note that Mini Circuits'
[ADE-1+](https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=ADE-1%2B), also
a double balanced diode ring mixer, is marketed as having a low 
conversion loss at 5.0 dB. 


For the suppression of the RF input and the local oscillator,
we have:

```{r echo=FALSE}
mdf %>% filter(IF_freq %in% c(5,14)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=RF_level, y =  IF_level, color = factor(LO_drive))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "RF level [dBm]",
       y = "IF level [dBm]") +
  facet_wrap( ~frequency_f)
```

We see that there is 40 dB suppression of the RF input, and more than 50 dB
suppression of the local oscillator. This is a bit worse, but not drastically
much worse, than the Mini Circuits part referenced above.
Given that performance with respect to the mixing products didn't depend
a lot on the drive level, it seems unnecessary to run this mixer at levels
higher than 4 dBm.
