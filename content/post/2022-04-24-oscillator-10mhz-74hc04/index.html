<p>It should be possible to use an inverter to create a simple oscillator,
and with a crystal it should be possible to set its frequency. This is a
design that is everywhere:</p>

<p>I built this using stripboard:</p>

<p>Powering it from 5V, it does seem to work.
The circuit draws a surprising amount of current: 40mA at 5V.
Without any termination
the waveform is not beautiful. Here is a screenshot from my oscilloscope:</p>

<p>I attempt to terminate it in 50 ohm at the scope end,
and that cleans up the waveform somewhat. Iâ€™m also happy to see that it has the strength to power such a load:</p>
