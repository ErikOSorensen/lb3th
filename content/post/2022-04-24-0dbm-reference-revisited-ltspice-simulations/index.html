<p>A while back I built up a circuit intended to prototype a leveling
circuit that could program the output level using a dc control voltage.
Hans Summers showed <a href="https://youtu.be/732ESoul088">such a circuit</a> for
7 MHz, and I thought it could be a nifty thing to have around. I made
some implementation error in my prototype that made this a frustrating
experience. My plan now was to revisit this circuit together with
trying to get LTspice working for me, and use this to understand both
more of the circuit and learn some useful software skills.</p>
<div id="the-circuit" class="section level1">
<h1>The circuit</h1>
<p>This is the circuit, modified only slightly, for LTspice:</p>
<p><img src="images/ltspice_schematic.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>I found the IRF510 spice model on the internet.</p>
<p>Steady state analysis of this circuit is deceptively straight forward.
The MOSFET amplifies, a filter shapes the output into a sine wave, and
D2 then rectifies and present a peak voltage to the negative input of the
op-amp. This is compared to the voltage reference (also through a diode
for symmetry), and then the op-amp adjusts the bias of the MOSFET to ensure
that the peak voltage of the filtered output has the level controlled by
the voltage reference at the positive input of the op-amp.</p>
</div>
<div id="startup" class="section level1">
<h1>Startup</h1>
<p>This circuit does not fit well with an AC analysis in LTspice, since the
DC operating point at the negative input clearly is 0V. Instead I would like
to simulate a transient analysis.</p>
<div id="the-first-10-ms" class="section level2">
<h2>The first 10 ms</h2>
<p>Below is the first type of plot of how the circuit starts up I made.</p>
<p><img src="images/10us.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>At first, this seemed like a failure. The MOSFET has a volt and a half of
10 MHz signal at a DC level of 8V on the gate, still there is no output.
How can that be? And there is no output, apart from an initial negative
spike. The op-amp cannot deliver more bias, and it just seems non-functional.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-first-500-us" class="section level2">
<h2>The first 500 us</h2>
<p>If we expand the time window to 500 micro seconds, we see more (and violent)
action.</p>
<p><img src="images/500us.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>From this picture it is clear that at initial startup, the circuit is
constrained by the voltage available at the drain because of the choke on the
supply. With a bit more time, that voltage level eventually get to where the
MOSFET can amplify (around 70 us), and we see wild voltage swings at
the drain and also the filtered output. The rectified output reaches almost 12V.</p>
<p>But then, at about 300us, the amplification starts to turn back, and at 400 us
there is only the DC operating voltage left at the drain since the gate level
is down to a level where the MOSFET is not turned on.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-first-200ms" class="section level2">
<h2>The first 200ms</h2>
<p>Simulating 500 us of a 10MHz requires a bit of computation time. And
as we saw, it was disappointing in that we did not achieve proper regulation
at the end of the period. So what if we instead attempt to simulate a much
longer startup period? This is inconvenient, since my computer only can
simulate at around 42 us/s. And even redrawing the screen as the
simulation progresses is very slow, since LTspice doesnâ€™t appear to decimate
the simulations before redrawing, so that is also very slow.</p>
<p><img src="images/200ms.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>Here we see that for the first 40 ms, we need to wait for the rectified
output to fall down to the reference level. After the initial disturbance
we saw above, this level takes time to go into the R6 resistor. This makes
sense, since the time constant of C10 and R6 is about 7ms.</p>
<p>When the rectified filtered output reaches the reference level, for a while
the bias at the MOSFET gate slowly starts to ramp up. At around 85ms, we see
some serious amplification, and a few ms after that the circuit
appears to have reached steady state with almost 6V pp at the filtered output.
The circuit keeps its regulated level for the rest of the simulation period.</p>
<p>Would there be advantages to reduce the time constant to reach regulation earlier?
I have experimented with smaller (and much smaller) values of R6. Everything is
faster, but the problem is then that there are more rapid changes in the
current of D2, and this induces a modulation of the output.</p>
