<p>I’ve bought some ferrites from “Kjell”, a local electronics chain.
The ferrites I bought are the <a href="https://www.kjell.com/no/produkter/data/datamaskinkomponenter/kontakter/ferrittblokk-12-mm-p90369">largest clamp-on style ferrites they
sell</a>.
I don’t know the material they are made of.</p>

<p>I’ve run a simple experiment: Connecting my Rigol signal generator to my Rigol oscilloscope
(terminated at 50 ohm), running either 1 or 7 turns through a ferrite core (7 turns
corresponds to the length of a stray wire on my bench). The improvised setup is probably not good above
15 MHz, but these are my data on calculated impedance.</p>
<p>Since both the generator and the scope is terminated in 50 ohms, the measured voltage at the scope end
should be
<span class="math display">\[V_s = \frac{50}{50 + 50 + X_{f}} V_{g},\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(X_{f}\)</span> being the unknown impedance,
<span class="math display">\[X_f = \frac{V_g}{V_s}\cdot 50 - 100.\]</span>
I sent 1V rms out of the generator.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>This is solid impedance also at the lower frequencies, even with only
one turn, and might indicate that the cores are made of a material that
will be useful RFI suppression at HF frequencies.</p>
